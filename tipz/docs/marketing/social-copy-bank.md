### Privacy Education

**EDU-1: Why Privacy Matters**
```
Your crypto tips are public.

Every one. Forever.

- Who you support
- How much you give
- When you give it

All indexed on blockchain explorers.

This is why we built TIPZ.
```

**EDU-2: Shielded Addresses Explained**
```
What is a shielded address?

Regular crypto: Public sender, receiver, amount.

Shielded (ZEC): All three are encrypted.

Only the parties involved can see the details.

That's what TIPZ uses.
```

**EDU-3: Cash Analogy**
```
Crypto tips today = Writing a check in public.

TIPZ = Cash in an envelope.

Same destination. Very different privacy.
```

**EDU-4: Public vs Private**
```
Transparent tip:
"0x7a3...sent 0.05 ETH to 0x9b2...at 14:32 UTC"

TIPZ tip:
"A transaction occurred."

That's the difference.
```

### How It Works

**EDU-5: Any Token Swaps**
```
"I don't have ZEC."

You don't need it.

TIPZ swaps your tokens automatically:
ETH → ZEC
USDC → ZEC
SOL → ZEC

You tip in whatever you hold. Privacy handled.
```

**EDU-6: Creator Setup**
```
Creator registration in 3 steps:

1. Get a Zcash shielded address (2 min)
2. Tweet it
3. Register at tipz.cash

Now your audience can tip you privately.
```

**EDU-7: Zero Fees**
```
TIPZ platform fee: 0%

Ko-fi: 0-5%
Buy Me a Coffee: 5%
PayPal: 2.9% + $0.30

Your tips. Your money. All of it.
```

**EDU-8: Self-Custody**
```
TIPZ never holds your funds.

Tips go directly to creator wallets.

No frozen accounts. No platform risk.

Self-custody is the point.
```

## Engagement (8 tweets)

### Questions

**ENG-1: Poll - Privacy**
```
Would you tip more creators if your support was private?
```

**ENG-2: Poll - Public Tips**
```
Have you ever NOT tipped a creator because the transaction would be public?
```

**ENG-3: Discussion Starter**
```
Hot take: Public tip amounts are weird and we should stop normalizing them.

Your support shouldn't be performative.
```

**ENG-4: Hypothetical**
```
What if your Venmo transactions were on a public blockchain?

Anyone could see who you paid, how much, when.

That's crypto tips today.
```

### Community Engagement

```
Creators: Drop your TIPZ link below.

4. Something else?
```

**ENG-7: Feature Request**
```
What should we build next?

1. Recurring private tips
2. Creator dashboard

```

Thank you for believing in privacy.

We're just getting started.
```

## Responses & Replies (8 tweets)

### Common Questions

**RSP-1: What is TIPZ?**
```
TIPZ = private tips for creators.

Tip in any token. Creator receives ZEC at a shielded address.

No public wallets. No visible amounts. No trace.

tipz.cash
```

**RSP-2: How is this private?**
```
Tips route through Zcash shielded addresses.

Sender, receiver, and amount are all encrypted.

The blockchain verifies the transaction is valid without revealing any details.
```

**RSP-3: Is Zcash legal?**
```
Zcash is legal in every major jurisdiction.

Privacy isn't a crime. It's a right.

When you close your curtains, you're not hiding crimes. You're exercising privacy.

Same principle.
```

**RSP-4: Why not PayPal/Venmo?**
```
PayPal:
- 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- Can freeze your funds
- Full identity required
- Reports to tax authorities

TIPZ:
- 0% fee
- Self-custody
- Pseudonymous
- Private by default
```

### Technical Questions

**RSP-5: What tokens can I tip with?**
```
ETH, USDC, USDT, SOL, AVAX, and 20+ more.

TIPZ uses NEAR Intents to swap automatically.

Tip in whatever you hold. Creator receives ZEC.
```

**RSP-6: How do swaps work?**
```
When you tip:

1. Your token goes to NEAR Intents
2. Automatic swap to ZEC via deep liquidity
3. ZEC sent to creator's shielded address

You see one transaction. Privacy handled behind the scenes.
```

**RSP-7: What if creator isn't registered?**
```
You'll see "Not on TIPZ" in the extension.

Want to tip them? Share our registration link.

Takes 2 minutes. Free forever.
```

**RSP-8: Is there an API?**
```
Developer access coming soon.
