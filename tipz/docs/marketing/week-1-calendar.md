## Day 2 - Wednesday

**Theme: Creator Focus**

### Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM PT)

**8:00 AM**
```
Thread: Why Creators Need Private Tips (5 tweets)

Tweet 1:
Why your crypto tips being public is a problem (a thread):

Tweet 2:
When you accept tips on most platforms, everyone can see:
- Your total earnings
- Who supports you
- Their wallet addresses
- Transaction amounts

That's not "transparency." That's surveillance.

Tweet 3:
Real creator problems from public wallets:
→ Competitors tracking your income
→ Harassers profiling supporters
→ Tax authorities with full visibility
→ Doxxing risk from wallet analysis

This isn't theoretical. It's happening.

Tweet 4:
TIPZ fixes this with Zcash shielded addresses.

Tips arrive in an encrypted pool. Only you can see:
- Who tipped (if they tell you)
- How much
- When

Everyone else? They see nothing.

Tweet 5:
Setup takes 2 minutes:
1. Get a shielded address (we recommend Zashi)
2. Tweet it
3. Register at tipz.cash

Your audience wants to support you privately.

Let them.
```

**1:00 PM**
```
Single Tweet: Easy Setup

"Setting up TIPZ looks complicated."

It takes 2 minutes:

2. Copy your shielded address (10 sec)
3. Tweet it (30 sec)
4. Register at tipz.cash (30 sec)

Done. You're now tippable.

Thread: How to Tip Privately (4 tweets)

Tweet 1:
How to tip creators without anyone knowing (including them):

Tweet 2:
Step 1: Install the TIPZ Chrome extension

Step 2: Connect your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

Step 3: Browse X (Twitter)

Tweet 3:
When you see a registered creator, you'll see a tip button next to their tweets.

Click it. Choose an amount. Confirm.

Done.

Tweet 4:
The creator receives ZEC to their shielded address.

They don't know your wallet.
Blockchain explorers can't track it.
No one links your support to your identity.

That's private tipping. tipz.cash
```

**10:00 AM**
```
Single Tweet: Any Token

You don't need ZEC to tip on TIPZ.

Tip with:
ETH
USDC
USDT
SOL
AVAX
And 20+ more

We handle the swap. Creator receives private ZEC.

Single Tweet: Use Case

Use case:

You want to support a controversial creator without your employer seeing.

Public tips: Everyone knows your wallet supported them.

TIPZ: No one knows. Not even the creator (unless you tell them).

Privacy matters.
```

**4:00 PM**
```
Single Tweet: Comparison

## Day 4 - Friday

**Theme: Technical Credibility**

### Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM PT)

**8:00 AM**
```
Thread: How TIPZ Works Under the Hood (5 tweets)

Tweet 1:
How TIPZ achieves private tipping (technical breakdown):

Tweet 2:
Layer 1: The Extension

Our Chrome extension injects a tip button on X.com posts.

When clicked, it opens a modal connected to your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)

Tweet 3:
Layer 2: Cross-Chain Swaps

You send ETH/USDC/SOL/etc.

The swap infrastructure routes your tokens through THORChain liquidity pools.

Output: ZEC

Tweet 4:
Layer 3: Shielded Destination

The ZEC doesn't go to a transparent address.

It goes directly to the creator's shielded (z-addr) address.

Sender, receiver, amount: all encrypted.

Tweet 5:
The result:

You: Confirm one transaction in your wallet
Creator: Receives ZEC in shielded pool
Blockchain: Shows a swap happened, not the details
You both: Private by default

That's TIPZ.

tipz.cash
```

**10:00 AM**
- [ ] Engage with any developer questions
- [ ] Check for technical feedback

### Afternoon (12:00 PM - 5:00 PM PT)

**1:00 PM**
```
Single Tweet: Non-Custodial

We never hold your funds.

When you tip on TIPZ:
→ Your wallet sends directly
→ Swap happens on-chain
→ ZEC arrives in creator's address

No custody. No middleman. No risk.
```

**3:00 PM**
```
Single Tweet: Stack Appreciation

Built on:

@zcash shielded addresses
@THORChain liquidity
@AvalancheLabs @solaboratories @ethereum for multi-chain support
