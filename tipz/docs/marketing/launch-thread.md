## The Thread

### Tweet 1/10 - Hook
```
Every crypto tip you've ever sent is public.

Your wallet. Their wallet. The amount. The timestamp.

All of it. Indexed forever.

What if it didn't have to be?

Introducing TIPZ.
```

### Tweet 2/10 - Problem
```
The problem with crypto tips today:

Send $5 to a creator? Now everyone knows:
- Your wallet address
- Their wallet address
- The exact amount
- When you sent it

Competitors track creator income.
Stalkers profile supporters.

This isn't tipping. It's surveillance.
```

### Tweet 3/10 - Solution
```
TIPZ fixes this with Zcash shielded addresses.

Your tip goes in. The creator gets paid.

No trace. No trail. No tracking.

Like cash in an envelope. But for the internet.
```

### Tweet 4/10 - Any Token
```
"But I don't have ZEC."

You don't need it.

TIPZ uses @NEARProtocol Intents to swap any token automatically.

ETH → ZEC
USDC → ZEC
SOL → ZEC

You tip in whatever you hold. They receive in private.
```

### Tweet 5/10 - Creator Setup
```
Creator setup takes 2 minutes:

1. Get a Zcash shielded address
2. Post a tweet with it
3. Register at tipz.app

Done. You're now tippable from anywhere your content lives.
```

### Tweet 6/10 - Tipper Flow
```
For tippers:

1. Install the TIPZ extension
2. Browse X or Substack
3. Click the tip button on any registered creator
4. Confirm in your wallet

Private tip sent. No one else knows.
```

### Tweet 7/10 - Why It Matters
```
Why private tipping matters:

Creators:
→ Competitors can't see your income
→ No doxxing from public balances
→ Financial privacy by default

Tippers:
→ Support without surveillance
→ No wallet tracking
→ Give without judgment
```

### Tweet 8/10 - Tech Stack
```
The stack:

@Zcash shielded addresses for privacy
@NEARProtocol Intents for any-token swaps
@THORChain for deep liquidity

The most private tipping infrastructure ever built.
```

### Tweet 9/10 - Creator CTA
```
Creators: Register at tipz.app

Free. 2 minutes. Zero platform fees.

Your audience wants to support you privately.

Let them.

### Tweet 10/10 - Final CTA
```
Privacy isn't a feature. It's a right.

TIPZ brings that right to creator support.

→ Creators: tipz.app
→ Tippers: Get the extension
→ Everyone: RT if tips should be private

One tip at a time.

## Alternative Hooks (A/B Test Options)

### Hook Option B - Question Lead
```
What if you could tip creators without anyone knowing?

Not your followers.
Not blockchain explorers.
Not your employer.
Not anyone.

That's TIPZ. Private tips. Any asset. Zero trace.
```
**Characters: 199**

### Hook Option C - Stat Lead
```
$4.2B in crypto tips were sent last year.

Every single one is public.

Sender. Receiver. Amount. Timestamp.

We built TIPZ to fix that.

Private tips. Any asset. Zero trace.
```
