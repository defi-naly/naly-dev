## The Thread

### Tweet 1/10 - Hook
```
Every crypto tip you've ever sent is public.

Your wallet. Their wallet. The amount. The timestamp.

All indexed. Forever.

What if it didn't have to be?

Introducing TIPZ.

tipz.cash

### Tweet 2/10 - Problem
```
The problem with crypto tips:

Send $5 to a creator? Now everyone knows:
- Your wallet address
- Their wallet address
- The exact amount
- When you sent it

Competitors track creator income.
Stalkers profile supporters.

This isn't tipping. It's surveillance.
```

### Tweet 3/10 - Solution
```
TIPZ fixes this with Zcash shielded addresses.

Your tip goes in. The creator gets paid.

No trace. No trail. No tracking.

Like cash in an envelope—but for the internet.
```

### Tweet 4/10 - Any Token
```
"But I don't have ZEC."

You don't need it.

TIPZ swaps any token automatically:

ETH → ZEC
USDC → ZEC
SOL → ZEC

Connect your existing wallet. Tip in whatever you hold.

They receive it privately.
```

### Tweet 5/10 - Creator Setup
```
Creator setup takes 2 minutes:

1. Get a Zcash shielded address (we recommend Zashi wallet)
2. Post a tweet with your address
3. Register at tipz.cash

Done.

You're now tippable from every post on X.

### Tweet 6/10 - Tipper Flow
```
For tippers:

1. Install the TIPZ Chrome extension
2. Browse X (Twitter)
3. See a tip button on registered creators
4. Click, confirm, done

Private tip sent.

No one else knows. Not even us.

### Tweet 7/10 - Why It Matters
```
Why private tipping matters:

For creators:
→ Competitors can't track your income
→ No doxxing from public wallet balances
→ Financial privacy by default

For tippers:
→ Support without surveillance
→ No wallet profiling
→ Give without judgment
```

### Tweet 8/10 - Tech Stack
```
Built on proven infrastructure:

@zcaboratories shielded addresses for privacy
Cross-chain swaps for any-token support
@THORChain for deep liquidity

Zero platform fees. Non-custodial. Private by default.

The tipping layer crypto deserves.

### Tweet 9/10 - Creator CTA
```
Creators: Register now at tipz.cash

Free forever. 2-minute setup. Zero platform fees.

Your audience wants to support you privately.

Let them.

### Tweet 10/10 - Final CTA
```
Privacy isn't a feature. It's a right.

TIPZ brings that right to creator support.

→ Creators: tipz.cash
→ Tippers: Chrome extension live now
→ Everyone: RT if tips should be private

Let's build a more private internet. One tip at a time.

## Alternative Hooks (A/B Test Options)

### Hook Option B - Question Lead
```
What if you could tip creators without anyone knowing?

Not your followers.
Not blockchain explorers.
Not your employer.
Not anyone.

That's TIPZ. Private tips. Any asset. Zero trace.

tipz.cash
```
**Characters: 209**

### Hook Option C - Provocative Lead
```
Crypto was supposed to give us financial freedom.

Instead, every tip you send is tracked, indexed, and analyzed.

Your generosity is someone else's data.

We built TIPZ to fix that.

tipz.cash
