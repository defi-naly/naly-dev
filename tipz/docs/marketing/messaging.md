## Feature Benefit Copy

### Shielded Transactions

**Headline**: "Tips that stay private"

**Body**: Unlike traditional crypto tips that expose both sender and receiver on a public blockchain, TIPZ routes all payments through Zcash shielded addresses. Your tip arrives without leaving a trace. The creator gets paid. No one else needs to know.

### Any-Token Swaps

**Headline**: "One destination, every token"

**Body**: Hold ETH? Great. USDC? Perfect. SOL? No problem. TIPZ uses NEAR Intents and SwapKit to automatically convert your tokens into ZEC before sending to the creator's shielded address. You tip in whatever you have. They receive in private.

### Browser Extension

**Headline**: "Tipping, native to your timeline"

**Body**: The TIPZ extension adds a tip button to every registered creator's posts on X and Substack. No copying addresses, no switching tabs. Just click, pick an amount, and send.

### Creator Registration

**Headline**: "Live in two minutes"

**Body**: Post a tweet with your Zcash address. Fill out the form. That's it. You're now tippable from anywhere your content appears.

## Objection Handling

### "Why do I need private tips?"

**Response**: Consider this: every tip you receive on most platforms is publicly visible. Competitors can see your earnings. Stalkers can track your income. Tax authorities see everything. With TIPZ, your financial life stays yours. Tips arrive in a shielded address where balances and transactions are encrypted by default.

### "Isn't Zcash for criminals?"

**Response**: Privacy isn't criminal - it's a right. When you close your curtains, you're not hiding crimes. You're exercising privacy. Zcash is regulated, auditable (when needed), and used by journalists, activists, and everyday people who believe finances should be private by default. Every major country allows its use.

### "Why not just use PayPal/Venmo/Stripe?"

**Response**:
- PayPal takes 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- They can freeze your funds without warning
- Every transaction is linked to your legal identity
- They report to tax authorities in most countries
- You can't receive anonymous support

TIPZ: 0% platform fee, self-custody, private by default.

### "This seems complicated"

**Response**: For creators: Post tweet → Paste address → Done. For tippers: Click button → Pick amount → Confirm. We've hidden all the complexity. You don't need to understand Zcash or swaps or shielded pools. Just click and tip.

### "What if the creator isn't registered?"

**Response**: You'll see "Not on TIPZ" next to unregistered creators. Want to tip them? Share our registration link. It takes 2 minutes, and you'll be able to tip them once they're set up.

```
The problem with crypto tips:

Send $5 to a creator? Now everyone knows:

- The exact amount
- When you sent it

Competitors track creator income.
Stalkers profile supporters.

This isn't tipping. It's surveillance.

## Blog Post: "Why Private Tips Matter"

### Title
**Why Private Tips Matter: The Case for Shielded Creator Support**

### Introduction
Every time you tip a creator in crypto, you're making a public statement. Not just "I support this person" - but "here's my wallet, here's their wallet, here's exactly how much I gave them, and here's when I did it."

In a world where blockchain explorers index everything and on-chain sleuths dox wallets for sport, this level of transparency isn't a feature. It's a liability.

### The Transparency Problem

Most crypto tipping today uses transparent blockchains like Ethereum or Solana. When you send a tip:

1. **Your wallet is exposed** - Anyone can look up your entire transaction history
2. **The creator's balance is visible** - Competitors, harassers, and tax authorities see everything
3. **The relationship is public** - Your support becomes a data point for analysis

This might seem fine until it isn't. Until a creator gets stalked based on their on-chain income. Until your employer finds your wallet and sees who you support. Until your financial privacy becomes someone else's intelligence.

### The Shielded Solution

Zcash invented shielded transactions in 2016. When you send ZEC to a shielded address:

- The sender is encrypted
- The receiver is encrypted
- The amount is encrypted
- Only the parties involved can see the details

It's the digital equivalent of cash in an envelope. The postman knows a letter was sent, but not what's inside.

### TIPZ Brings Shielded Tips to Everyone

We built TIPZ because creators deserve financial privacy and supporters deserve to give without surveillance.

With TIPZ:
- Creators register a shielded address
- Tippers use any token they have
- TIPZ handles the swap to ZEC
- The tip arrives, private by default

No platform sees your transaction. No blockchain explorer tracks your generosity. No data broker profiles your support patterns.

### The Future of Creator Support

As AI makes on-chain analysis easier and regulatory pressure mounts globally, private transactions become more important - not less.

We believe the future of creator support is:
- Private by default
- Token-agnostic for tippers
- Self-custodied for creators
- Zero platform fees

TIPZ is building that future.

### Get Started

Creators: Register at tipz.cash - it takes 2 minutes.
Tippers: Install the extension and start supporting creators privately.

Privacy isn't paranoia. It's a right. Let's build a more private internet together.
