## Detailed Description

```
TIPZ adds a private tip button to X (Twitter) posts from registered creators. Support the people you follow without exposing your wallet or their income.

HOW IT WORKS
--------------
1. Install TIPZ
2. Browse X (Twitter) as usual
3. See a tip button on registered creator posts
4. Click to tip any amount
5. Confirm in your wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
6. Done - creator receives a private tip

WHY PRIVATE TIPS MATTER
-----------------------
Regular crypto tips are public. Everyone can see:
- Your wallet address
- The creator's wallet address
- Exactly how much you tipped
- When you sent it

TIPZ changes this. Tips arrive in Zcash shielded addresses where the transaction details are encrypted. Only the creator can see what they received.

FEATURES
--------
* Private by default - Tips arrive in Zcash shielded addresses
* Any token accepted - Use ETH, USDC, SOL, AVAX, or 20+ other tokens
* Automatic swaps - We convert your tokens to ZEC behind the scenes
* Zero platform fees - Creators keep 100% of tips
* Non-custodial - We never hold your funds
* Simple UX - One click to tip from any tweet

FOR CREATORS
------------
Want to receive private tips? Register at tipz.cash in 2 minutes:
1. Get a Zcash shielded address (we recommend Zashi wallet)
2. Post a tweet with your address
3. Register at tipz.cash
4. Get your profile page: tipz.cash/yourusername

PRIVACY COMMITMENT
------------------
TIPZ is built on Zcash, a cryptocurrency designed for privacy. Shielded transactions encrypt the sender, receiver, and amount. This isn't mixing or obfuscation - it's native privacy at the protocol level.

We don't track your tips. We don't store your wallet addresses. We don't profile your activity.

SUPPORTED WALLETS
-----------------
* MetaMask
* WalletConnect-compatible wallets
* Coinbase Wallet
* Rainbow
* And more

SUPPORTED TOKENS
----------------
ETH, USDC, USDT, DAI, SOL, AVAX, MATIC, BNB, and 20+ more tokens across multiple chains.

Privacy isn't paranoia. It's a right.
