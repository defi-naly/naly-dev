## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Mert Mumtaz DM

```
Hey Mert,

Building something you might find interesting—private tipping for creators using Zcash shielded addresses.

Saw your tweets about ZEC and figured you'd appreciate someone actually shipping shielded-by-default products. We use NEAR Intents for any-token swaps so tippers can use ETH/USDC/whatever, and it all arrives as shielded ZEC.

Extension works on X.com—tip button shows up next to tweets from registered creators.

Would love your take if you have 5 min to try it: tipz.cash

No pressure, just thought you'd want to know this exists.

[name]
```

**Key elements**:
- Acknowledges his ZEC advocacy
- Explains product concisely
- Technical enough to be interesting
- Clear CTA
- No ask for promotion

### Template 2: Josh Swihart / cashZ Team

```
Hi Josh,

Congrats on the cashZ launch—exciting to see the team building on the Zashi foundation.

We just shipped TIPZ, a private tipping tool for X/Twitter creators using Zcash shielded addresses. Any-token tips automatically swap to ZEC and arrive shielded.

Wondering if there's potential for integration or collaboration. Our users need wallets, and your users might want to receive tips.

Happy to share more about the architecture or jump on a call if interesting.

tipz.cash if you want to see it in action.

[name]
```

**Key elements**:
- Acknowledges their work
- Clear value proposition
- Proposes mutual benefit
- Open to conversation

### Template 3: Zcash Community Channels

```
Hey everyone,

We just launched TIPZ—private micro-tipping for creators using Zcash shielded addresses.

How it works:
- Creators register with their shielded address
- Tippers use our browser extension on X/Twitter
- Any token tips automatically swap to ZEC
- Tips arrive in shielded pool—private by default

Built this because we believe shielded should be the standard, not the exception. Creator income shouldn't be publicly visible.

Would love feedback from the community: tipz.cash

Happy to answer questions here.
```

**Key elements**:
- Clear explanation
- Emphasizes shielded-by-default philosophy
- Invites feedback
- Community-focused tone

### Template 4: Follow-Up (After No Response - 1 Week)

```
Hey [name],

Following up on TIPZ—we've had [X] creators register and [Y] tips sent since launch last week.

Quick win if you want to try: register your handle (takes 2 min), and I'll send you a test tip so you can see the full flow.

No worries if not your thing, just wanted to close the loop.

[name]
```

**Key elements**:
- Shows traction
- Offers concrete action
- Low-pressure
- Provides closure

### Template 5: After Positive Interaction

```
Really appreciate you checking out TIPZ, [name].

If you end up mentioning it, here's some copy that might help:

"TIPZ: Private tips for creators. Any token → shielded ZEC. tipz.cash"

Or feel free to say whatever feels authentic—genuinely just appreciate the support.

Let me know if you ever want to chat about Zcash adoption or privacy tech. Always happy to connect.
