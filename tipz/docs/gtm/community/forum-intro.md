## The Post

**Title**: Introducing TIPZ - Private Micro-Tipping for Content Creators

---

Hello Zcash community,

I wanted to introduce something we've been building: **TIPZ** - a private tipping platform for content creators that uses Zcash shielded addresses.

### The Problem We're Solving

Every existing tipping platform has the same issue: your financial activity is visible.

- Traditional platforms (Ko-fi, Buy Me a Coffee) share data with payment processors
- Crypto tipping via ETH/SOL/BTC is publicly visible on-chain
- Even "private" payment apps aren't actually private

For creators, this means anyone can see:
- How much they earn from tips
- Who their biggest supporters are
- Their income patterns over time

This isn't just a privacy concern - it's a safety issue. Creators get targeted, harassed, and doxed based on their earnings.

### What TIPZ Does

TIPZ brings shielded-by-default tipping to the creator economy:

1. **Creators register** their Zcash shielded address at tipz.app
2. **Tippers install** our browser extension
3. **Tip buttons appear** next to tweets on X.com (more platforms coming)
4. **Tips can be sent** in any token - ETH, USDC, SOL, or others
5. **Automatic swap** via NEAR Intents routes tips to ZEC
6. **Private settlement** - tips arrive in the creator's shielded address

The result: tippers can use whatever token they have, creators receive private ZEC, and no one can track the financial relationship.

### Why We Built on Zcash

We evaluated several privacy solutions and chose Zcash for specific reasons:

**Shielded addresses work**: Unlike mixing or obfuscation, Zcash shielded transactions are natively private. There's no complex setup, no timing analysis risk, no reliance on anonymity sets.

**Ecosystem maturity**: Good wallet support (Zashi, YWallet, etc.), established infrastructure, and a real community that cares about privacy.

**Cross-chain compatibility**: NEAR Intents and THORSwap/Maya Protocol support ZEC well, enabling our any-token-to-shielded flow.

**Regulatory standing**: Zcash has clearer regulatory positioning than some alternatives, which matters for mainstream creator adoption.

### How It Benefits Zcash Adoption

We believe TIPZ can meaningfully grow Zcash usage:

**New users**: Every creator who registers needs a shielded address, which means downloading a Zcash wallet. Every tipper who wants to send ZEC directly needs to acquire it.

**Real utility**: This isn't speculation - it's people using ZEC for an actual purpose. "I use ZEC to receive tips" is a concrete use case.

**Regular transactions**: Active creators receive tips regularly, driving ongoing shielded transaction volume.

**Positive narrative**: "Private creator income" is a use case that's easy to explain and hard to criticize. It reframes privacy as protection, not evasion.

### Our Philosophy

We're not here to extract value from the Zcash ecosystem - we're here to contribute to it.

We believe:
- **Shielded should be default**, not optional
- **Financial privacy is a right**, not a privilege
- **The best privacy is invisible** - users shouldn't have to think about it

We're building TIPZ because we think every creator deserves financial privacy, and Zcash is the only technology that actually delivers it.

### Current Status

- **Web app**: Live at tipz.app
- **Extension**: Available for Chrome (Firefox coming)
- **Platforms**: X.com support live, Substack in development
- **Architecture**: Fully non-custodial, direct to shielded addresses

### What We'd Like From This Community

**Feedback**: What would make TIPZ more useful? What concerns do you have? What did we get wrong?

**Testing**: If you're a creator (or know one), we'd love for you to try it. Register at tipz.app and let us know how the experience is.

**Ideas**: What other integrations or features would help Zcash adoption? We're listening.

**Patience**: We're a small team. We'll make mistakes. We're committed to fixing them and improving based on your input.

### Questions We're Happy to Answer

- How does the swap mechanism work?
- What data do we store?
- Is it custodial? (No)
- What's on our roadmap?
- How do we handle [specific technical question]?

Ask anything - we'll be monitoring this thread.

Thanks for reading. We're genuinely excited to be building on Zcash and to be part of this community. The shielded-by-default thesis is correct, and we're here to prove it in the real world.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

## Alternative Shorter Version

If the full post is too long for the forum culture:

**Title**: TIPZ - Private Tips for Creators via Zcash Shielded

---

Hi everyone,

Just launched TIPZ - private micro-tipping for X/Twitter creators using Zcash shielded addresses.

**How it works:**
- Creators register their shielded address
- Tippers use our browser extension
- Any token tips swap to ZEC via NEAR Intents
- Tips arrive shielded

**Why Zcash:** Shielded addresses are real privacy. No mixing, no obfuscation, no timing analysis. Just native privacy that works.

**Why this matters:** Creator income shouldn't be on a public ledger. Financial privacy is a safety issue for many creators.

We'd love feedback from the community. What would make this more useful? What did we miss?

Try it: tipz.app

Happy to answer questions here.
