# TIPZ Partnership Strategy

Ecosystem integration and partnership development roadmap.

---

## Partnership Thesis

TIPZ succeeds when the Zcash ecosystem succeeds. Our partnership strategy focuses on:
1. **Wallet integrations** - Make receiving tips frictionless
2. **Infrastructure recognition** - Get featured by protocols we use
3. **Community credibility** - Earn trust through contribution

## Priority Partnerships

### Tier 1: Wallet Integrations

#### Zashi Wallet

**What they are**: Official Zcash mobile wallet, built by ECC
**Status**: Live, actively maintained
**Why it matters**: Primary onramp for new Zcash users

**Integration Opportunities**:
1. **Ecosystem listing**: Get TIPZ featured in Zashi's "apps" or "ecosystem" section
2. **Deep linking**: "Open in Zashi" for address generation
3. **Co-marketing**: Joint announcement of integration

**Proposal Outline**:
```
Subject: TIPZ + Zashi Integration Proposal

Summary:
TIPZ brings private micro-tipping to X/Twitter creators using Zcash shielded addresses. We'd like to explore integration with Zashi to improve the user journey.

Proposed integrations:
1. Feature TIPZ in Zashi ecosystem/apps discovery
2. Deep link support for "create address in Zashi" from TIPZ registration
3. Optional: Transaction notifications for incoming tips

Value for Zashi:
- Drives new users to download Zashi
- Real-world shielded use case
- Increases transaction volume
- Creator economy = high-value users

Value for TIPZ:
- Smoother creator onboarding
- Credibility from official wallet
- Shared audience

Next steps:
- 30-min call to discuss feasibility
- Technical review of deep linking options
- Timeline for implementation

Looking forward to exploring this.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Partnership theater**: Don't announce partnerships that aren't real
2. **Over-promising**: Be realistic about what we can deliver
3. **Begging**: Come from a position of value, not need
4. **Exclusivity traps**: Don't lock into exclusive deals too early
5. **Distraction**: Don't let partnership pursuit slow product development

---

## Long-Term Vision

**Phase 1 (Now)**: Wallet integrations for better UX
**Phase 2 (3-6 months)**: Infrastructure recognition, grants
**Phase 3 (6-12 months)**: Ecosystem leadership position

**Ultimate goal**: TIPZ becomes the default tipping layer for Zcash ecosystem, recommended by wallets and supported by the community.
