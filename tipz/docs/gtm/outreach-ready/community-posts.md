## Zcash Discord Introduction

**Channel**: #general or #projects (check current channel structure)
**Timing**: After initial launch thread goes live

```
Hey everyone! Wanted to introduce something we just launched: TIPZ - private micro-tipping for content creators.

What it is:
- Creators register their shielded Zcash address
- Tippers install a browser extension
- Tip button appears next to tweets on X.com
- Any token tips automatically swap to ZEC and arrive shielded

Why we built it on Zcash:
We believe creator income shouldn't be publicly visible. Zcash shielded transactions are the only real solution for financial privacy that actually works. No mixers, no obfuscation - just native privacy.

We're using NEAR Intents for cross-chain swaps, so tippers can use ETH, USDC, SOL, whatever - it all ends up as shielded ZEC.

Would love feedback from the community. We're here to answer questions and improve the product.

Check it out: tipz.cash

Title: Built a private tipping tool for creators using shielded addresses

Hey r/zcash,

Wanted to share something we just launched: TIPZ - private micro-tipping for X/Twitter creators.

How it works:
1. Creators register their shielded address at tipz.cash
2. Tippers install our browser extension
3. Tip button appears next to tweets
4. Tips can be in any token - they swap to ZEC and arrive shielded

Built this because I noticed all existing tipping solutions either charge fees or expose transactions publicly. Creator income shouldn't be on a public ledger.

We're using NEAR Intents for cross-chain swaps, so the tipper experience is flexible while the creator always receives shielded ZEC.

Would love feedback from the community. What would make this more useful? What concerns do you have?

## Response Templates

### For "How is this different from just sending ZEC directly?"

```
Great question! The main differences:

1. **Discovery**: Tippers can tip any creator on X.com directly from tweets. No need to find/share addresses separately.

2. **Any token**: Tippers can use ETH, USDC, SOL, etc. - no need to already have ZEC.

3. **Shielded by default**: All tips arrive in shielded addresses. Direct sends often use transparent addresses.

4. **Creator experience**: One registration, tips from any platform user without coordination.

We handle the complexity so both sides get the best experience.
```

### For "Is this custodial?"

```
No - we never hold funds. Here's the flow:

1. Tipper initiates transaction with their wallet
2. NEAR Intents handles the cross-chain swap
3. ZEC arrives directly in the creator's shielded address

We just facilitate the connection and swap routing. The creator's shielded address is the destination from the start.
```

### For "What about regulatory concerns?"

```
We take compliance seriously while believing financial privacy is a fundamental right.

- Zcash is a regulated, auditable cryptocurrency
- Shielded transactions can be disclosed when legally required (viewing keys)
- We focus on legitimate use cases: creator income privacy

Privacy isn't about hiding illegal activity - it's about not having your financial life on a public ledger.
```

### For "Why Zcash instead of Monero/other privacy coins?"

```
A few reasons:

1. **Shielded addresses work like normal addresses**: Easy to integrate, familiar UX
2. **Ecosystem maturity**: Good wallet support, established infrastructure
3. **Regulatory clarity**: Zcash has clearer regulatory standing
4. **Cross-chain compatibility**: NEAR Intents and THORSwap support ZEC well

We're not against other privacy solutions, but Zcash hit the right balance for our use case.
