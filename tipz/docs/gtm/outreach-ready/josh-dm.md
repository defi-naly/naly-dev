## The Message

```
Hi Josh,

Congrats on cashZ - exciting to see the team continuing to build on what you started at ECC. The ecosystem needs fresh energy.

We just launched TIPZ: private micro-tipping for X/Twitter creators using Zcash shielded addresses. Tippers can use any token - we handle the swap via NEAR Intents - and tips arrive as shielded ZEC.

Reaching out because I see potential synergy:
- Our creators need wallets to receive tips
- Your users might want to receive tips for their content
- We both want more shielded transaction volume

Would love to explore integration possibilities. Could be as simple as recommending cashZ for address generation, or deeper like tip notifications in-wallet.

Happy to share more about our architecture or jump on a call if you're interested.

tipz.cash to see it in action.

Looking forward to connecting.
```

## If He Responds Positively

Send this follow-up:

```
Great to hear from you.

Here's what I'm thinking for potential integration:

Lightweight option:
- We recommend cashZ in our "How to get a shielded address" onboarding
- Deep link to cashZ from TIPZ registration page
- Cross-promote in both communities

Deeper option:
- In-app notification when tips arrive
- "Receive tips with TIPZ" feature in cashZ
- Joint announcement at cashZ launch

Happy to start with the lightweight version and build from there.

Would a 30-minute call work to discuss? I'm flexible on timing.
```

## If He Asks About Technical Integration

Be prepared to discuss:
- How we store/verify shielded addresses
- Our API structure for creators
- Webhook possibilities for tip notifications
- Deep linking protocols
- Timeline and development resources

---

## If He's Cautious/Skeptical

Acknowledge it directly:

```
Totally understand wanting to see traction first.

We're heads down on launch right now. Happy to reconnect in a few weeks once we have real numbers to share.

Would it be helpful if I sent over a brief one-pager on the integration we're envisioning? No commitment, just context for when the timing is right.
```

## If No Response After 5-7 Days

Send one follow-up:

```
Hi Josh - following up on my TIPZ note.

Understand you're probably deep in cashZ launch prep. Happy to reconnect when timing is better.

Quick update: we've onboarded [X] creators and facilitated [Y] shielded tips in our first week.

The integration idea stands whenever you have bandwidth.

Best of luck with the launch.
```

## Partnership Talking Points

**Why cashZ + TIPZ makes sense:**
- Same ecosystem, same mission (shielded adoption)
- Our users need a wallet recommendation
- Their users get a new use case for their wallet
- Combined we create a full "earn and spend" loop

**What we can offer:**
- Featured wallet recommendation in onboarding
- Traffic to their app store listing
- Real use case for their early users
- Willing to adapt our flow to their UX

**What we'd like:**
- Ecosystem/app listing in cashZ
- Deep link support
- Optional: tip notification feature
- Co-marketing at their launch

---

## Notes

- Josh has deep Zcash credibility - his endorsement matters to the community
- cashZ is new, may be more open to partnerships than established wallets
- The ECC transition creates a "fresh start" opportunity
- Position as allies, not competitors
- Be patient - wallet launches are complex, he may not have bandwidth immediately
