## Pre-Send Checklist

## The Message

```
Hey Mert,

Been following your ZEC takes - the "shielded by default" thesis is spot on.

We just shipped something you might find interesting: TIPZ - private tipping for creators on X using Zcash shielded addresses.

How it works:
- Creators register their shielded address
- Tippers use any token (ETH, USDC, SOL, whatever)
- NEAR Intents handles the swap, tips arrive as shielded ZEC

Extension works right on X.com - tip button shows up next to tweets.

Built this because creator income shouldn't be on a public ledger. Figured you'd appreciate someone actually shipping shielded-by-default products instead of just talking about it.

Would love your take if you have 5 min: tipz.app

Happy to answer any questions on the architecture - it's a fun build.
```

## If He Responds Positively

Send this follow-up:

```
Really appreciate you checking it out.

If you want to test the full flow:
1. Register your handle at tipz.app (takes 30 sec)
2. I'll send you a test tip so you can see the shielded transaction

No pressure either way - just wanted to offer.

Would be happy to chat more about Zcash adoption if you're ever interested. Always good to connect with people who get why shielded matters.
```

## If He Asks Technical Questions

Be prepared to discuss:
- How NEAR Intents routes cross-chain swaps
- Why we chose shielded over transparent
- Extension architecture and security model
- Future roadmap (more platforms, direct swaps, etc.)

---

## If No Response After 5-7 Days

Send one follow-up:

```
Hey Mert - quick follow-up on TIPZ.

We've had [X] creators register and sent [Y] tips in our first week. Shielded adoption growing.

Offer still stands if you want to try it: tipz.app

No worries if not your thing - just wanted to close the loop.
```

Then move on. Don't follow up again.

- He'll likely want to see the product actually work before engaging publicly
- His audience is highly technical - any mention he makes will drive quality signups
- Don't oversell or hype - he'll see through it immediately
